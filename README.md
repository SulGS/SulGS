I'm a programmer student. Since I was 12 years old(now I am 24 years old), I have been learning to develop videogames as a hobbie, and now i'm studying computer engineering.

## Skills

##### Game development
I have experience development videogames, especially with Unity

##### Problem solving
I consider that I have a quick logic to solve a problem and translate it into code.

##### Team Working
I enjoy working in teams and helping everyone to reach a common goal. There is no better experience than doing group projects and helping each other out.
